### Experience

  <div class="announcement-item">
    <p class="announcement-title">Software Engineer, KLA Computational Physics [5/2025]</p>
    <p>
      Accepted KLA sponsorship for masters degree. This includes full time employment during
      summers and part time employment during the school year. I focused specifically on the
      electron optics of scanning electron microscope simulation that needed acceleration. The most
      significant part of this is Coulomb N-Body interaction of electrons, the result of my work on
      this was that this computation was moved to the GPU and utilized a tree based method allowing
      scaling of the number of particles from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> per GPU.

  <div class="announcement-item">
    <p class="announcement-title">Software Internship, KLA Computational Physics [5/2024]</p>
    <p>
      Did skunkworks for a brand new project that aims to simulate the underlying physics of
      scanning electron microscopes. Skunkworks included refactoring and developing infrastructure
      for starting simplified core models. Reached 800X speedup for generation of secondary
      electron yield emissions using Numba Cuda. This has significant applications for CAE
      (Computer Aided Engineering), Systems Engineering, and Synthetic Data generation for AI
      Algos. This project is now a fully funded project and 3 PhDs and I are continuing to work on
      this full time. I continued this work on a part time basis during my senior year of undergrad.

  <div class="announcement-item">
    <p class="announcement-title">Software Internship, KLA SW Infra [5/2023]</p>
    <p>
      Developed the underlying Apache Airflow code to deploy ML models using K8s with GPU support,
      and dynamic control for number of training instances. Included deploying my own K8s cluster,
      learning containerization & NVIDIA GPU Operator.
